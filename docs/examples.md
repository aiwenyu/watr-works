CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS

The exploration of the system Tl-Ba-Cl-O was performed,
starting from mixtures of TlCl, Tl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, BaO, and BaO<sub>2</sub>
pressed into the form of bars and heated in evacuated silica tubes at temperatures ranging from 530°C to 660°C.

The new phase Ba<sub>3</sub>Tl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>C1<sub>2</sub> was synthesized
for the nominal composition Ba<sub>2.8</sub>Tl<sub>2.2</sub>O<sub>4.5</sub>C1<sub>2</sub> ,
heated slowly up to 6OO”C, maintained at that temperature for 6 hours, and then slowly cooled down to room temperature.

Under these conditions, the phase appears as practically pure from its powder XRD pattern, which evidences only traces of BaCO,.

> Samples were analysed using a Bruker D2 Phaser benchtop X-ray diffractometer equipped with LYNXEYE 1Ddetector with Cu–Kα radiation at room temperature.
> The samples were analysed using a step size of 0.02° and dwell time of 0.2 s per step.
> Rietveld refinements of XRD data were performed using GSAS/ EXPGUI [13,14] software to determine the structural parameters and the amount of cation disorder.
> The refinement strategy that imposed to validate the refinement model was performed according to the literatures [15–17].
>
> The electrodes were electrochemically characterised by using a 2016 coin cell (20 mm outside diameter and 1.6 mm thickness).
> The cells were fabricated in the argon-filled glove box with lithium foil as the anode, and 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) + dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (with a mixing ratio of 1:1 V/V) as the electrolyte.
> The cells were tested using Cyclic Voltammetry Macpile II (Biologic, France) to determine the oxidation/reduction of the samples at a sweep rate of 0.058 mV s−1 voltage range of 2.5–4.4 V.
> Bitrode battery tester (Model SCN-12-4-5/18, USA) was used to perform galvanostatic cycling in order to assess the performance of the cells.
> The cells were tested by charging and discharging in the voltage range of 2.5–4.5 V (vs. Li).
> These tests were carried out at room temperature at a constant current density of 15 mA g−1.
