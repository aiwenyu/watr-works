### Synthesis
> CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS
> The exploration of the system Tl-Ba-Cl-O was performed, starting from mixtures of TlCl,
> Tl,O,, BaO, and BaO, pressed into the form of bars and heated in evacuated silica tubes at
> temperatures ranging from 530°C to 660°C. The new phase Ba,Tl,O,Cl, was synthesized
> for the nominal composition Ba,,,Tl,,20, &12, heated slowly up to 6OO”C, maintained at that
> temperature for 6 hours, and then slowly cooled down to room temperature. Under these
> conditions, the phase appears as practically pure from its powder XRD pattern, which
> evidences only traces of BaCO,.
