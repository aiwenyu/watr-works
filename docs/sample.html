<h2> Single-Crystal X-Ray and Powder Neutron Diffraction of ThB& (ThB$-Type) </h2>

<h3> ... </h3>


<p>
B,C-kagome net between the Th-layers was suggested by Toth et al. (I).

<br/>
Complete indexing (6) of the powder pattern of UBzC, however, disclosed an even larger (rhombohedral) cell (ahex = aoti, chex = 34 which also applied for the ThB*C phase,


<br/>
Based on this information a detailed study of the crystal structure of ThB2C became the subject of the present work.

The starting materials were: thorium in the form of arc-melted buttons prepared from powder as obtained from Cerac Inc. with a
claimed purity of 99.8%; carbon, reactor grade, impurities cl.4 ppm, Carbonne Lorraine, France; boron, 98.15% “B-enriched
isotope, AERE Harwell, UK, impurities ~6000 ppm; and solid pieces of crystallized boron from H. C. Starck, Goslar, BRD, 99.8%.

</p>

<br/>
<p>
To ensure homogeneity, the alloy buttons were turned over and remelted several times; weight losses were checked to be within 2% of the original weight.

<br/>
<p>
For annealing at 1600°C the alloys contained in cylindrical Knudsen-type carbon crucibles
were heated for 48 hr in a tungsten sheet metal high-vacuum furnace at lop4 Pa.


<br/>
<p>
Starting from a nominal composition 25 at% Th, 50% B, and 25% C virtually singlephase
and well-crystallized products were obtained in all cases.

<br/>
Only minor amounts of ThBC (less than about 10%) were observed for the “B-isotope containing alloy.


== para
<br/>
<p>
Precise lattice parameters and standard deviations were obtained by a least-squares
refinement of room-temperature GuinierHuber X-ray powder data, using monochromatic
Cu Z&i radiation with an internal standard of 99.9999% pure Ge (uGe = 0.5657906 nm).

<br/>
<p>
A small but significant variation was observed for the lattice parameters of the new compound confirming the
existence of a small homogeneity region in agreement with earlier observations by (1).
